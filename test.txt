Test automation pyramid: 
4#Unit Tests/Component Tests,
 3#Acceptance tests(API layer),
 2#GUI tests,
 1#Manual tests. 
Deeper test automation level, better the ROI. A nice table for relative costs to fix
 software defects: Design_%_Implementation_%_Testing_%_Maintanence. Glossary 
at the end is useful. All of a sudden, 4 testing quadrants is a cool thing for 
understanding certain pathways.
